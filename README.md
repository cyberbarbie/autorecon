# autorecon
Kali Linux Reconnaissance Automation Script 
Written By Tae'lur Alexis/@Cyberbarbie

Objective: Perform reconnaissance on your target domain and gathers intel on subdomains, directories and files and open ports and services

Tools Used:
- Nmap (Port discovery)
- Dirsearch (Directory enumeration)
- Gobuster (Subdomain enumeration)
- Amass (Subdomain enumeration)
- Assetfinger (Directory Enumeration)
- Crt.sh (Certificate Authority)

How it Works:
- Run `/.autorecon.sh` 
- Type domain name when prompted
- Tool initiates and performs recon on target

Future iterations:
- Create 2 modes: Stealth Mode (Passive recon-only tools) and Active Mode (A mixture of passive and active recon tools)
